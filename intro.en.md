# What is remote work?

From a company standpoint, remote work is the choice to trust people to work from any location for undefinite lengths of time. From a worker perspective, remote work is continuative work which happens away from the office or plant.

While remote work can happen from home, work from home usually implies that, at some point, you are expected back to the office, and that the only *other* place of work is your home. Therefore, they are not the same thing.

Thus, remote has two main qualities:

* it is not bound to a location
* the ability, and the necessity, to do so at indefinite length


Work should be bound by time (things do not have to happen at the same moment), nor should it wholly depend on others to go forward.

Note to contributors, please add some more introduction text. Assume an audience that does not know remote work at all. The objective of this part is to set up the basic knowledge needed to understand the manifesto and principles.

We are in "brainstorm" mode now: feel free to add what comes to your mind, don't delete or change others' work (except grammar).
