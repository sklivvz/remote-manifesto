# Principles of Remote Working

1. Overcommunication

Communication in the office also takes place at the coffee machine or in the hallways. Remotely this isn't possible and must be offset with a commitment to overcommunicate in chat, also by explaining what you do in real-time (e.g. "I'm gonna have a coffee!")

2. Accountability

Accountability is key to disseminate knowledge between the organization in a safe way, it destroys siloes and fosters high commitment on getting good quality work in. It requires having a safe place to talk about what has gone well and what has gone wrong (e.g., blameless postmortems) and to distribute that information widely and making sure that there are no punishments.

3. Trust

Managers must trust their team to focus on achieving the desired results and the team members must not require micromanagement and trust that their manager will be willing and able to remove any blockers that may exist. Remote micromanagement is not efficient (nor really possible in the general case.)

4. Autonomy

For autonomy to be useful in a business setting it must be accompanied by alignment and empathy. The team must know what the goals are and must be able to resolve conflicts in case of conflicting goals by themselves, wherever possible. Other than that, each team and member should be able to decide how to achieve the stated goals.

5. Allignment

Higher management need to ensure everyone is alligned to the same high level goal. This informs the team members and helps with individual and group goal setting and decision making, especially when multiple options are on the table which are not easily differentiated (e.g. "make the best user experience").

Note to contributors, please stick to the "numbered title plus two lines explanation" format. The purpose of the princples is to explain the main manifesto points, not by repeating them, but by showing how to take them and apply them to everyday work.

We are in "brainstorm" mode now: feel free to add what comes to your mind, don't delete or change others' work (except grammar).
