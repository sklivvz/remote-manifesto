# Remote Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of working remotely by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

* Communication and collaboration over siloing and specialization
* Asynchronicity and just-in-time interaction over instantaneous communication
* Timezones over countries
* Trust over micromanagement
* Accountability over fear
* Transparency over opacity
* Aligned autonomy over command and control
* Servant leadership over do-what-I-say management
* Physical distance over social distance (SARS-CoV-2 related)
* Measuring over just winging it
* Measuring results and output over measuring time spent and inputs
* Productivity over screen time/time in seat
* Thinking over reacting

Note to contributors, please add points in the same "xxx over yyy" format only.

We are in "brainstorm" mode now: feel free to add what comes to your mind, don't delete or change others' work (except grammar).

(work in progress, see [README.md](./README.md))
